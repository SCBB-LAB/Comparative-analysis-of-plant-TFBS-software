# DeepBind
## Introduction
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a DeepBind model that came out in 2015. The model described in the paper ["Predicting the sequence specificities of DNA and RNA-binding proteins by deep learning"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3300) is implemented within Pytorch was taken from ["DeepBind-with-PyTorch"](https://github.com/MedChaabane/DeepBind-with-PyTorch). The detailed explanation of the architecture can be found in the [supplementary notes of the paper](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnbt.3300/MediaObjects/41587_2015_BFnbt3300_MOESM51_ESM.pdf). 

The architecture of the model and the calibration phase steps are explained in this **Figure 1** from the paper:

## 1. Environment setup

We recommend that you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install all of the following software.

#### 1.1 Create and activate a new virtual environment

```
conda activate
```

#### 1.2 Install the package and other requirements

Run following command to install pytorch

```
python3 -m pip install --pre torch torchvision -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu111/torch_nightly.html -U
```

To download and extract the source code for DeepBind and move to parent directory, type following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/SCBB-LAB/comparative_analysis_of_plant_TFBS_software/DeepBind.git
cd DeepBind
```

#### 1.3 Software Requirements

***software list***
- python >=3.6
- pytorch
- numpy 
- pandas
- sklearn
- scipy 
- matplotlib


## 2. Data information

#### 2.1 Data processing

In this part, we will first introduce the **data information** used in this model, then introduce the training **data formats**, and finally introduce how to create a data set that meets to build the model requirements.

We have provided example data format compatible with DeepBind input data format (DeepBind input data format: See [example input data](https://github.com/SCBB-LAB/comparative_analysis_of_plant_TFBS_software/DeepBind/blob/master/example/ABF2_pos.txt). If you are trying to train DeepBind with your own data, please process your data into the same format as given in above example input data.

#### 2.2 Model Training Based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Create input and output data repositories**

Make sure to make directories to store your input data and output results before model training.

**To create input data directory**
```
mkdir example/
cp ABF2_*.txt example/
```
**To create output data directory**
```
mkdir output/
```
- **Training** 
**Input:** `ABF2_train.txt`,`ABF2_test.txt`. 
All data input files need to be placed in the same folder before training, such as in [example directory](https://github.com/SCBB-LAB/comparative_analysis_of_plant_TFBS_software/DeepBind/blob/master/example). To train DeepBind with your own data, please process your data into the same format as it.

**Usage:**
Run the following command in the parent directory:
```
python3 deepbind.py ABF2
```

**Output:** 

**Final result** 
The trained model and best hyperparameter, (`ABF2_Model.pth`) and (`ABF2_best_hyperpamarameters.pth`), are saved in the `output/` directory, respectively. 
The outfile file (`ABF2_result.txt`) located at `output/` directory contains the performance metrics of the test dataset.
