Xin Feng wrote PeakRanger. Four functions from PeakSeq are
included(Paper by Joel Rozowsky, et. al. Coded in C 
by Theodore Gibson). Some sources codes from Bowtie are also 
used. Bowtie can be downloaded from http://bowtie-bio.sf.net.
Source codes from Bamtools are also included 

PeakRanger's region detection algorithm is derived from PeakSeq.

PeakRanger also uses the following files from Bowtie:

assert_helpers.h
timer.h

The doc generation system is also adopted from the Bowtie package. 

PeakRanger supports BAM/SAM file I/O with the help from the Bamtools 
library, specifically, using the following files:

BamAux.h  
BamReader.cpp  
BamReader.h  
BGZF.cpp  
BGZF.h
