# iFORM (Find Occurrence of Regulatory Motifs (iFORM)) 
This is a tool for scanning DNA sequences with TF motifs represented as PWMs, which integrates five traditional motif discovery programs, namely FIMO, Consensus, STORM, RSAT, and HOMER, through Fisherâ€™s combined probability test.
To run iFORM on your input data, enter into the paraent directory:
```
cd iFORM
```

## 1.1 Data information
The software require the transcription factor specific Position Weight Matrix (PWM) and the genomic fasta file.
## 1.2 Usage
TO run iFORM successfully run following command:
```
./iForm --bgfile motif-file --o output_result Example/AT2G28810_pwm.txt Example/AT2G28810_pos.fa >> AT2G28810_out.txt
```
**Final output:** Final motif file is saved to `AT2G28810_out.txt` in the parent directory.
